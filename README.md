# 📝 To-Do List Application

A feature-rich to-do list web application designed to help users organize tasks efficiently. The app allows users to add tasks with descriptions, due dates, edit, delete, sort, and mark them as done. All tasks are stored using **Web Storage (localStorage)**, so they persist across sessions.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Add New Tasks**: Create tasks with a name, description, and due date.
- ✏️ **Edit and Delete Tasks**: Update task details or delete tasks as needed.
- 🔄 **Mark as Done/Undo**: Mark tasks as complete or undo completion for finished tasks.
- 🔍 **Sort by Due Date**: Sort tasks in ascending or descending order based on due dates.
- 💾 **Persistent Storage**: Uses `localStorage` to save tasks, ensuring tasks are retained after a page refresh.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the to-do list interface.
- **CSS (Tailwind CSS)**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, providing a modern and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Handles all task management logic and interactions with `localStorage`.
- **Web Storage (localStorage)**: Stores tasks in the browser, keeping them available across sessions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A web browser with JavaScript enabled.
